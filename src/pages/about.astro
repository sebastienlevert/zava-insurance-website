          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>Zava Insurance was founded in 1987 by Maria and Eduardo Zava in Hartford, Connecticut. What started as a small family-owned agency with a single office and a commitment to honest service has grown into one of the region's most respected insurance providers.</p>
          <p>Eduardo, a first-generation immigrant from Portugal, understood what it meant to build something from nothing. He believed that everyone — regardless of background — deserved access to reliable protection for their families, homes, and livelihoods.</p>
          <p>Today, Zava Insurance serves over 250,000 policyholders across 12 branch locations, while still honoring the personal touch that Maria and Eduardo built into every interaction. The company is now led by their daughter, Sofia Zava-Mitchell, who carries forward the family's legacy of trust, integrity, and community service.</p>

          <p>We believe that protection shouldn't be a luxury. Every policy we write is backed by a promise to stand beside our clients in their most challenging moments — whether it's a fender bender, a house fire, or a medical emergency.</p>
          <p>Our mission drives every decision we make, from the products we design to the communities we serve. We measure our success not just by policies sold, but by the families we help recover, the businesses we keep running, and the peace of mind we deliver.</p>

          <p>We envision a future where every person has access to the protection they need, delivered with transparency and empathy. We're investing in technology to make insurance simpler, faster, and more personalized — while never losing the human connection that defines Zava.</p>
          <p>By 2030, our goal is to expand to 25 branch locations, launch fully digital policy management, and double our community investment through the Zava Cares Foundation.</p>
